	<title>Island Explorer route map</title>

<body>
	<main class="content">
		<p>A "tube-style" map that displays information about the Island Explorer bus routes in Acadia National Park. The maps have been designed with the following in mind:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Quickly see where routes are connected to each other by bus stops so that riders can determine which route or routes can get them to their destination.</li>
			<li>The relationships between the paths of routes. This is useful when flagging down a bus from a trailhead or another location that does not have a designated stop.</li>
			<li>Minimize the distractions that are caused by maps with routes that are overlayed on a geographically accurate depiction where roads have turns and switchbacks and important details may be obscured.</li>
			<li>Provide a list of stops with helpful information that includes the routes that access the stop, facilities (restorooms, drinking water, etc.), and points of interest (trailheads, geographic features, etc.).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Two page <a href="2018/island-explorer-routes-2018.pdf" alt="Island Explorer route stops">downloadable PDF</a> with both routes and stops on Acadia National Park and Mount Desert Island for the Island Explorer.</p>
